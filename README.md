Developed a website and mobile app that enables clients to book bus tickets and access a unique QR code for their trip. This system includes features such as ticket scanner and mask wearing to ensure safe travel during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, designed a powerful system for the bus door that only opens if the passenger is wearing a mask, scans the ticket's code and recognizes the passenger's face from attached data.
